Currently I have configured it to use the demo token from https://www.simplefin.org/. The transactions are dated with 1970-01-01. But as I defautled the App to show current month, default month selection is not working as there is no transaction or budget assinged for it. So you will need to manually select "01" 
month from the filter.
